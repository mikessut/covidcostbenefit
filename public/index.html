      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      In an effort to encourage thought about the consequences of policies and their tradeoffs, this
      site strives to crowd source what some of the trade offs of policy decisions are related to the
      COVID-19 pandemic.  The site is very much a work in progress at the moment and has been an opportunity
      for me to learn some web development tools.  It is open source, and if you have any suggestions, please don't
      hesitate to contact me and submit a pull request from the
